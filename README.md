# TIPOO_connector_testCollector
Draft of the project. <br />
Project discontinued. <br />
The idea was to have the possibility to make a test, in the TIPOO system, in the local computer version. <br />
So use sockets in Java to send asks to local machine, solve them and get the answers back to the server.

netTest - Directory with drafts of the socket connection.<br />
TIPOOconnector - Mini module to send the answers back to the server.
